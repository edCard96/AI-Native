# Cinema Sleuth ðŸŽ¬

Cinema Sleuth is an interactive movie guessing game where players try to identify movies through yes/no questions.

## Description

Think of a movie and let Cinema Sleuth try to guess it! The game works like this:
- You think of any movie
- Cinema Sleuth asks you questions that can only be answered with "Yes" or "No"
- Based on your answers, Cinema Sleuth will try to deduce which movie you're thinking of
- The game continues until Cinema Sleuth either guesses correctly or runs out of questions

## Features (Coming Soon)
- Smart question algorithm that learns from player responses
- Extensive movie database covering various genres and eras
- Questions about:
  - Release year (e.g., "Was it released after 2000?")
  - Genre (e.g., "Is it a comedy?")
  - Cast (e.g., "Does Tom Hanks appear in this movie?")
  - Plot elements (e.g., "Does it take place in space?")
- Score tracking for both player and AI success rates
