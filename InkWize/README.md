## Development Notes
- **Backend:**
  - `server.js` serves static HTML and proxies Comic Vine API requests.
  - Endpoints: `/api/comics`, `/api/search`, `/api/comic/:id`, `/api/auth/*`.
  - Only English comics are shown by default.
- **Frontend:**
  - Main UI in `InkWize.html` and related HTML files.
  - Profile section is demo-only and generates random data on each load.
  - All navigation and UI logic is handled client-side with vanilla JS.
- **Testing:**
  - Run `node test-api.js` to test the `/api/comics` endpoint.

## Environment Variables
- You can set a custom Comic Vine API key in a `.env` file:
  ```env
  COMICVINE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
  The app uses a public demo key by default.
